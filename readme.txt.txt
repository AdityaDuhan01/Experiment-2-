# Experiment 2 – Frontend Web Development

## Aim
To design and develop interactive frontend applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate DOM manipulation and event handling.

---

## Description
This experiment consists of three frontend mini-projects implemented using JavaScript:

1. Word Counter – counts words in real time with a maximum limit.
2. Product Filter – filters products based on selected category.
3. Mouse Drawing – allows users to draw on screen using mouse movements.

All projects are purely frontend-based without backend integration.
